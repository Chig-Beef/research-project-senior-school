            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>This webiste was created in order to help Middle School students transition into Senior School.</p>
            <h2>Sections</h2>
            <p>This website has many sections, such as the teachers section, and the classrooms section.</p>
            <h3>Teachers</h3>
            <p>This section has information on each teacher, including the subjects they teach and where to find them.</p>
            <h3>Staff</h3>
            <p>This section, much like the Teacher Section, has information on each of the staff and what they do.</p>
            <h3>Classrooms</h3>
            <p>Here will be information on each of the classrooms, such as the room's rules and the subjects that are taught there. There is also a map of the school.</p>
            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>This section contains information on each subject, the teachers who teach it, what is learnt, and assignments.</p>

                <h2>General information</h2>
                <h3>Differences</h3>
                <p>There are many differences between Middle School and Senior School, such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is no bell in senior school, you are expected to arrive on classes on time by your own accord.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Room numbers</h3>
                <p>When teachers tell you where a classroom is, they may say something like "3F17".</p>
                <p>The 3 refers to the block number, so block 3.</p>
                <p>The F tells you whether it is ground level (G) or on the first floor (F).</p>
                <p>The last two numbers are just the room code, so you have to look at the number on each classroom's door to find the correct one.</p>
                <p>The rooms are usually in order.</p>
                <p>If the specific room number isn't given for a teacher, you can find their office in Senior School Student Services.</p>
